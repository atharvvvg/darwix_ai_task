Part 1: Corrected System Architecture
This architecture is streamlined to support only the blog application and the AI title suggestion feature.

1. Core Technologies
   Backend Framework: Django (~5.0)
   API Framework: Django REST Framework (~3.15)
   AI for Title Suggestions: Google Gemini API (via google-generativeai Python SDK)
   Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for production)
   Environment Management: python-dotenv
   Python Version: ~3.11+
2. File and Folder Structure
   This is the lean structure required for the task. The ai_features app is now solely dedicated to title suggestions.

Use code with caution. 3. Component Breakdown: What Each Part Does
src/core/: Standard Django project configuration. settings.py will load the GEMINI_API_KEY from the environment. urls.py will route /api/ traffic to the ai_features app.
src/blog/: A standard Django app defining the BlogPost model (models.py) which holds the content we will analyze.
src/ai_features/: The Django app containing all logic for the title suggestion feature.
services/title_generator.py: This is the core AI integration point. It will contain a TitleGenerator class that:
Initializes the Gemini API client using the GEMINI_API_KEY.
Contains a method suggest_titles(content: str) that takes blog content as input.
Constructs a specific prompt for the Gemini model, asking for 3 titles in a JSON format.
Makes the API call, parses the response, and returns a clean Python list of strings.
Handles potential errors from the API call.
views.py: Contains the SuggestTitlesView (an APIView). Its job is to:
Receive a POST request containing the blog content.
Instantiate the TitleGenerator service.
Call the suggest_titles method with the content.
Return the list of suggestions as a JSON response with a 200 OK status.
Handle bad requests (e.g., no content provided) with a 400 status.
urls.py: Defines the single endpoint path('suggest-titles/', SuggestTitlesView.as_view()). 4. State and Service Connections
State:
Configuration State (API Key): Lives in the .env file, loaded into the environment at startup.
Persistent State (Blog Posts): Lives in the database (e.g., db.sqlite3), managed by the Django ORM via the blog.models.BlogPost model.
Ephemeral State (Request Data): The blog content sent for title suggestions exists only in memory for the duration of a single API request. The application itself is stateless.
Service Connection Flow:
